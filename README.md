# NRCodeChallenge

This project has been done using a TDD approach and tries to follow SOLID guidelines and a DDD architecture. Any feedback will be very appreciated.

# How to use it
Once you download the code, open the NRCodeChallenge.sln file with Visual Studio.
Wait until the Nuget packages are restored.
If you want the service to use your own GitHub credentials go to the RestClientOptions.cs file and change the return statement of Username and Password fiels. In that way you would be able to make up to 5000 thousand calls per hour.
Select the NRCodeChallenge.WebApi and then click the Play button in the toolbar. That should launch the web API.
